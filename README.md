## About this Project 📊
This project involves creating a relational HR employee database in SQL  and deriving analyses and insights based on the dataset.

## Files in this Repository 📁

### Python Notebook:
This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code I used for mainly for data cleaning and data wrangling. The original dataset has little cleaning needed so most of the code were just making the csv file suitable for flatfile importing in Microsoft SQL.

### CSV Files:
These are the outputs of the cleaned files processed through Python. Please note that I did not create these databases, nor do I claim ownership of them.
